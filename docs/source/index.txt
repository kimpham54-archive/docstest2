## Introduction

Islandora CLAW is the next generation of Islandora. Still in development, this major upgrade will be compatible with [Fedora 4](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Fedora+Repository+Home).

## Repository Structure

* [Alpaca](https://github.com/islandora-claw/Alpaca): Event driven middleware based on Apache Camel that synchronizes a Fedora 4 with Drupal.
* [Chullo](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/Chullo): A PHP client for Fedora 4 built using Guzzle and EasyRdf.
* [Crayfish](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/Crayfish): Top level container for the various Islandora CLAW microservices, lovingly known as Crayfish.
* [docs](./docs): Documentation!
* [install](./install): Bleeding edge development environment
* [islandora](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/islandora): Islandora CLAW Drupal modules
* [PDX](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/pdx): Top level container for the various [PCDM](http://pcdm.org/) specific Islandora CLAW microservices.

Note: the [Ansible](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/claw-ansible) and [Docker](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=docker) repositories are early, experimental provisioning tools for the CLAW stack. For context see [this](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/CLAW/issues/182). Development is focused on the vagrant / bash environment referenced above, which is the recommended starting point for working with CLAW.
